        learn="In this exciting course, you will explore the many aspects and parts that impact the successful management of projects. You will learn about project, program, and portfolio management, and the best practices that accompany each.
 
        During this course you will dive deep into the PMBOK, where you will learn about the project life cycle. In addition, you will learn about the five process groups lying within the project lifecycle: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. You will then delve into the 10 Knowledge Areas that make up every project: Integration, Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resource, Communications, Risk, Procurement, and Stakeholder Management. Your trainers will help you understand the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs within each knowledge area.
