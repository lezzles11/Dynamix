        title="Certified SAFe® Agile Software Engineer" 
        about="A foundational Lean-Agile and DevOps course for SAFe practitioners." 
        learn="This three-day course provides attendees with the foundational knowledge required to establish their credentials as a Certified Scaled Agile Framework® (SAFe®) Agile Software Engineer. We start with principles behind iterative software development in a SAFe environment, which include the key concepts of managing product backlogs from user stories and requirements, demonstrating value, and incremental and iterative delivery.  An Agile Software Engineer must be equally knowledgeable in DevOps as well as in Lean-Agile, and our expert faculty provide a comprehensive overview.
 
        A Certified Agile Software Developer certificate holder will be expected to show competency in all aspects of an Agile iterative software development environment.  From the SAFe software developer’s perspective, the course prepares the student in all aspects of the Agile software development process.  Instructors use real-life examples to show students key SAFe skills and then students are given an opportunity to practice the same skills.  As in other SAFe certificate programs, participants in the class explore the importance of adopting a customer-centric mindset and design thinking approach to agile product delivery.
         
        After completing the course, participants will be able to demonstrate their knowledge of the theory and practice needed for participating as a SAFe Agile Software Engineer in their enterprise.  All students who successfully complete the course will be prepared to take the Certified SAFe® Agile Software Engineer exam.
