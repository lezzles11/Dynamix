        about="An intermediate-level course for SAFe practitioners in a Lean-Agile environment." 
        learn="This two-day course provides attendees with intermediate-level information about using the Scaled Agile Framework® (SAFe®) as a team member Lean-Agile enterprise.  We first review the key concepts behind iterative software development in a SAFe environment, which include managing product backlogs from user stories and requirements, demonstrating value, and incremental and iterative delivery.  We then cover the daily responsibilities of an Agile practitioner and their use of Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming.
 
        A Certified SAFe Practitioner certificate holder will be expected to show competency in all aspects of an Agile iterative software development environment.  From the perspective of an SAFe practitioner, the course prepares the student in all aspects of the Agile software development process.  Instructors use real-life examples to show students key SAFe skills and then students are given an opportunity to practice the same skills.  As in other SAFe certificate programs, participants in the class explore the importance of adopting a customer-centric mindset and design thinking approach to agile product delivery.
         
         
        After completing the course, participants will be able to demonstrate their knowledge of the theory and practice needed for participating as a SAFe practitioner in their enterprise.  All students who successfully complete the course will be prepared to take the Certified SAFe® Practitioner (SP) exam.
