        learn="Is your team wanting to learn more about Scrum and Kanban principles in order to enhance your team and working environment? If so, these two workshops have been designed with you in mind. Choose one or both, depending on your teamâ€™s needs. 
 
        In our Kanban team workshops, your team will learn about what Kanban actually is and the best practices associated with using it. You will learn about how and when to use it in your team environment, and how you can best incorporate it in your team with other Agile practices you are currently using, or hope to use in future. Our trainers will also demonstrate how to create a Kanban board, and will show you many examples of how different teams use Kanban boards. By the end of this workshop, your team will be ready, able, and empowered to incorporate and use Kanban in your organization to maximize their success and delivery of products. 
         
        If Scrum training is what your team needs, then look no further. Our Scrum workshops are designed to equip your team with a deep understanding of the Scrum framework and be able to then apply Scrum principles in a working environment. During this one day course, your team will learn about Agile principles and the foundational values and roles that form the basis of Scrum. Trainers will provide instruction on Scrum theory, the Scrum framework, and the role of the Scrum Master within the Scrum environment. Your team will participate in workshops during the course, where they will practice applying the knowledge about Scrum into real world situations and work environments. At the end of the course, your team will understand the Scrum framework, be able to apply this knowledge through application, Scrum events, and Scrum roles.
