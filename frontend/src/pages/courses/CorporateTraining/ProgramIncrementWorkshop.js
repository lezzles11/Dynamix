        This workshop guides participants through the process of defining the program increment, guiding its development cycle, and realizing its functionality through deployment.  Practicing Scrum without a program increment is merely wasted effort and a lost opportunity.  This customized workshop shows your team how to successfully define and deliver the PI.
        "
