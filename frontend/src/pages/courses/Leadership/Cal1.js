        title="Certified Agile Leadership" 
        about="A foundational course for managers to prepare for the Agile Leadership 1 certificate" 
        learn="This foundational two-day course provides attendees the background required to achieve the Certified Agile Leadership 1 certification from the Scrum Alliance. The training is oriented towards information technology (IT) product managers, supervisors, directors, leaders, coaches, or anyone in a managerial position who is interested in learning to apply Agile principles to their leadership.
 
        The applicability of Agile management techniques extends throughout the IT industry and beyond. This course will demonstrate many of those techniques that prove useful for common organizational and management challenges, such as, effective leadership of distributed and diverse teams, delivering value, and promoting the Scrum values of courage, focus, commitment, respect and openness. From their experience in both the Agile and non-Agile worlds, Apexâ€™s instructors will show you how to value: individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.
         
        A Certified Agile Leadership 1 certificate holder will be expected to have an understanding of management practices, particularly those found in IT organizations. From the perspective of an experienced IT manager, the course prepares the student to apply Agile techniques to attain advanced leadership and management responsibilities in a enterprise environment. Course instructors draw from their own real-life experience to immerse the student in actual business scenarios.  From there, instructors provide guidance in the application of Agile techniques.
         
        After completing the course, participants will be able to demonstrate their knowledge of the theory and practice needed for Agile leadership.  All students who successfully complete the course will be prepared to take the Certified Agile Leadership 1 exam.
