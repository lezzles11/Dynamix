First, producing value: does\n                          leadership recognize that the production of value over\n                          the production of features? Second, encouraging\n                          change: does leadership not only welcome change, and\n                          not only encourage change, but actually reward change?\n                          And third, deliver frequently: does leadership guide\n                          the organization to processes conducive to continuous\n                          improvement and delivery?

The Dynamix Agile Organization\n                          Assessment will measure your current capabilities as\n                          an Agile organization. We will identify those areas\n                          where you are on the right track as well as those\n                          where you are following practices that are\n                          counterproductive.

Among\n                          others metrics, we assess the following key\n                          capabilities: value: do each your product releases\n                          produce recognizable and useful value for the\n                          customer; openness to change: are your organizations\n                          receptive and encouraging of changing requirements,\n                          both early and late in the product cycle; and frequent\n                          deliveries via a continuous improvement and delivery\n                          pipeline.\n                        </MDBCardText>\n                      </MDBCol>\n                    </MDBCol>\n                  </MDBJumbotron>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <h6>Portfolio Assessment</h6>\n                  <MDBJumbotron style={{ padding: 0 }}>\n                    <MDBCol className=\"text-white text-center py-2 px-2 my-2\">\n                      <MDBCol className=\"py-2\">\n                        <MDBCardText className=\"mx-2 mb-2\">\n                          Rarely does a company produce a single product or\n                          feature that is divorced from other cooperating\n                          products. In an organization with multiple and\n                          simultaneous development efforts, a siloed approach to\n                          product development becomes counterproductive.

We\n                          look at the team dynamics: how much trust is there\n                          between team members? Is there a team culture, and if\n                          so, is the culture beneficial to, or detrimental to,\n                          the team’s success?
