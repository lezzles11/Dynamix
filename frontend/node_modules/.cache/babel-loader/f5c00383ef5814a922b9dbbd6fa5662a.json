As outlined in the Agile\n                        Manifesto, the following principles are of paramount\n                        importance to leaders. First, producing value: does\n                        leadership recognize that the production of value over\n                        the production of features?

And third,\n                        deliver frequently: does leadership guide the\n                        organization to processes conducive to continuous\n                        improvement and delivery?

Like a\n                        tried and true family recipe, we have distilled our\n                        decades of experience in the software industry to create\n                        a comprehensive assessment of software development\n                        practices. Among others metrics, we assess the following\n                        key capabilities: value: do each your product releases\n                        produce recognizable and useful value for the customer;\n                        openness to change: are your organizations receptive and\n                        encouraging of changing requirements, both early and\n                        late in the product cycle; and frequent deliveries via a\n                        continuous improvement and delivery pipeline.\n                      </MDBCardText>\n                    </MDBCol>\n                  </MDBCol>\n                </MDBJumbotron>\n                {/* </li> */}\n                {/* <li> */}\n                <h6 align=\"center\">Portfolio Assessment</h6>\n                <MDBJumbotron style={{ padding: 0 }}>\n                  <MDBCol className=\"text-white text-center py-2 px-2 my-2\">\n                    <MDBCol className=\"py-2\">\n                      <MDBCardText className=\"mx-2 mb-2\">\n                        Rarely does a company produce a single product or\n                        feature that is divorced from other cooperating\n                        products.
