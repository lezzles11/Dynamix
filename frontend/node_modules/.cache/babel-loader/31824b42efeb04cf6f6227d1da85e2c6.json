First, producing value: does\n                          leadership recognize that the production of value over\n                          the production of features? Second, encouraging\n                          change: does leadership not only welcome change, and\n                          not only encourage change, but actually reward change?\n                          And third, deliver frequently: does leadership guide\n                          the organization to processes conducive to continuous\n                          improvement and delivery?

We will identify those areas\n                          where you are on the right track as well as those\n                          where you are following practices that are\n                          counterproductive. Like a tried and true family\n                          recipe, we have distilled our decades of experience in\n                          the software industry to create a comprehensive\n                          assessment of software development practices.

We\n                          look at the team dynamics: how much trust is there\n                          between team members? Is there a team culture, and if\n                          so, is the culture beneficial to, or detrimental to,\n                          the team’s success?
