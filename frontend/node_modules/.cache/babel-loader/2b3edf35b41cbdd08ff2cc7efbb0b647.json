The training is oriented towards Agile leaders, coaches, and Scrum Masters. Starting with a review of Lean-Agile principles, you will be guided through the intricacies of Agile Release Trains and the challenges for implementing these principles in an enterprise setting. A Certified SAFe Release Train Engineer certificate holder will be expected to have a thorough understanding of the key Lean-Agile concepts and practices. From the perspective of an already expert SAFe practitioner, the course prepares the student for advanced leadership, coaching and Scrum Master responsibilities in a enterprise SAFe environment.  Instructors draw from their own real-life experience to immerse the student in actual business scenarios.  From there, instructors guide students to create, manage and deploy ARTs. As this is intermediate- to advanced-level training, students gain an appreciation both for the power, as well as the shortcomings, of ARTs in an enterprise setting. After completing the course, participants will be able to demonstrate their knowledge of the theory and practice needed for implementing Agile Release Trains in a Lean-Agile environment.
