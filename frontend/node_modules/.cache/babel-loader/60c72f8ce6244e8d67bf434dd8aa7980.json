Starting with a review of Lean-Agile principles, you will be guided through the intricacies of Agile Release Trains and the challenges for implementing these principles in an enterprise setting. A Certified SAFe Release Train Engineer certificate holder will be expected to have a thorough understanding of the key Lean-Agile concepts and practices. From the perspective of an already expert SAFe practitioner, the course prepares the student for advanced leadership, coaching and Scrum Master responsibilities in a enterprise SAFe environment.  Instructors draw from their own real-life experience to immerse the student in actual business scenarios.  From there, instructors guide students to create, manage and deploy ARTs. As this is intermediate- to advanced-level training, students gain an appreciation both for the power, as well as the shortcomings, of ARTs in an enterprise setting.
