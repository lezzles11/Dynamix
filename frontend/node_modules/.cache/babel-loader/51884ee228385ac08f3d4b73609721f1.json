We will identify those areas\n                          where you are on the right track as well as those\n                          where you are following practices that are\n                          counterproductive. Like a tried and true family\n                          recipe, we have distilled our decades of experience in\n                          the software industry to create a comprehensive\n                          assessment of software development practices. Among\n                          others metrics, we assess the following key\n                          capabilities: value: do each your product releases\n                          produce recognizable and useful value for the\n                          customer; openness to change: are your organizations\n                          receptive and encouraging of changing requirements,\n                          both early and late in the product cycle; and frequent\n                          deliveries via a continuous improvement and delivery\n                          pipeline.\n                        </MDBCardText>\n                      </MDBCol>\n                    </MDBCol>\n                  </MDBJumbotron>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <h6>Portfolio Assessment</h6>\n                  <MDBJumbotron style={{ padding: 0 }}>\n                    <MDBCol className=\"text-white text-center py-2 px-2 my-2\">\n                      <MDBCol className=\"py-2\">\n                        <MDBCardText className=\"mx-2 mb-2\">\n                          Rarely does a company produce a single product or\n                          feature that is divorced from other cooperating\n                          products. In an organization with multiple and\n                          simultaneous development efforts, a siloed approach to\n                          product development becomes counterproductive. Do your\n                          product teams operate independently or is there a\n                          cooperative spirit aligning your goals? Is progress\n                          gated by milestones and measured by the number of\n                          tasks completed? Many of the same techniques you apply\n                          to iterative software development also apply to\n                          portfolio management. Our portfolio assessment\n                          ascertains where you sit on an Agile spectrum and more\n                          importantly, what practices can you adopt that will\n                          bring value, openness to change, and improved delivery\n                          to your product portfolio.\n                        </MDBCardText>\n                      </MDBCol>\n                    </MDBCol>\n                  </MDBJumbotron>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <h6>Program Assessment</h6>\n                  <MDBJumbotron style={{ padding: 0 }}>\n                    <MDBCol className=\"text-white text-center py-2 px-2 my-2\">\n                      <MDBCol className=\"py-2\">\n                        <MDBCardText className=\"mx-2 mb-2\">\n                          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing\n                          elit.\n                        </MDBCardText>\n                      </MDBCol>\n                    </MDBCol>\n                  </MDBJumbotron>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <h6>Team Assessment</h6>\n                  <MDBJumbotron style={{ padding: 0 }}>\n                    <MDBCol className=\"text-white text-center py-2 px-2 my-2\">\n                      <MDBCol className=\"py-2\">\n                        <MDBCardText className=\"mx-2 mb-2\">\n                          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing\n                          elit.\n                        </MDBCardText>\n                      </MDBCol>\n                    </MDBCol>\n                  </MDBJumbotron>\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <h6>Individual role/talent</h6>\n                  <MDBJumbotron style={{ padding: 0 }}>\n                    <MDBCol className=\"text-white text-center py-2 px-2 my-2\">\n                      <MDBCol className=\"py-2\">\n                        <MDBCardText className=\"mx-2 mb-2\">\n                          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing\n                          elit.\n                        </MDBCardText>\n                      </MDBCol>\n                    </MDBCol>\n                  </MDBJumbotron>\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n            </MDBCol>\n          </MDBRow>\n          <MDBRow\n            style={{\n              position: \"absolute\",\n              left: \"50%\",\n              transform: \"translate(-50%, -50%)\",\n            }}\n          >\n            <Link to=\"/contactus\">\n              <MDBBtn color=\"blue\">Contact Us</MDBBtn>\n            </Link>\n          </MDBRow>\n        </MDBCardBody>\n      </MDBCard>\n    </MDBContainer>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Assessments;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
