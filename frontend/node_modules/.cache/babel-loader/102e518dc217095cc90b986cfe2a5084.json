The Dynamix Agile leadership assessment\n                        quantitatively assesses the skills and capabilities of\n                        your leadership team. As outlined in the Agile\n                        Manifesto, the following principles are of paramount\n                        importance to leaders. First, producing value: does\n                        leadership recognize that the production of value over\n                        the production of features? Second, encouraging change:\n                        does leadership not only welcome change, and not only\n                        encourage change, but actually reward change? And third,\n                        deliver frequently: does leadership guide the\n                        organization to processes conducive to continuous\n                        improvement and delivery? Dynamix Agile’s leadership\n                        assessment comprehensively surveys leadership skill in\n                        your organization, and it produces recommendations to\n                        get leadership on the right track to agility.\n                      </MDBCardText>\n                    </MDBCol>\n                  </MDBCol>\n                </MDBJumbotron>\n                {/* </li> */}\n                {/* <li> */}\n                <h6 align=\"center\">Organization Assessment</h6>\n                <MDBJumbotron style={{ padding: 0 }}>\n                  <MDBCol className=\"text-white text-center py-2 px-2 my-2\">\n                    <MDBCol className=\"py-2\">\n                      <MDBCardText className=\"mx-2 mb-2\">\n                        As important as Agile is to your software development\n                        teams, many of the same principles apply to your\n                        organization. The Dynamix Agile Organization Assessment\n                        will measure your current capabilities as an Agile\n                        organization. We will identify those areas where you are\n                        on the right track as well as those where you are\n                        following practices that are counterproductive. Like a\n                        tried and true family recipe, we have distilled our\n                        decades of experience in the software industry to create\n                        a comprehensive assessment of software development\n                        practices. Among others metrics, we assess the following\n                        key capabilities: value: do each your product releases\n                        produce recognizable and useful value for the customer;\n                        openness to change: are your organizations receptive and\n                        encouraging of changing requirements, both early and\n                        late in the product cycle; and frequent deliveries via a\n                        continuous improvement and delivery pipeline.\n                      </MDBCardText>\n                    </MDBCol>\n                  </MDBCol>\n                </MDBJumbotron>\n                {/* </li> */}\n                {/* <li> */}\n                <h6 align=\"center\">Portfolio Assessment</h6>\n                <MDBJumbotron style={{ padding: 0 }}>\n                  <MDBCol className=\"text-white text-center py-2 px-2 my-2\">\n                    <MDBCol className=\"py-2\">\n                      <MDBCardText className=\"mx-2 mb-2\">\n                        Rarely does a company produce a single product or\n                        feature that is divorced from other cooperating\n                        products. In an organization with multiple and\n                        simultaneous development efforts, a siloed approach to\n                        product development becomes counterproductive. Do your\n                        product teams operate independently or is there a\n                        cooperative spirit aligning your goals?
