The training is oriented towards information technology (IT) product managers, supervisors, directors, leaders, coaches, or anyone in a managerial position who is interested in learning to apply Agile principles to their leadership. The applicability of Agile management techniques extends throughout the IT industry and beyond. This course will demonstrate many of those techniques that prove useful for common organizational and management challenges, such as, effective leadership of distributed and diverse teams, delivering value, and promoting the Scrum values of courage, focus, commitment, respect and openness. From their experience in both the Agile and non-Agile worlds, Apex\u2019s instructors will show you how to value: individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan. A Certified Agile Leadership 1 certificate holder will be expected to have an understanding of management practices, particularly those found in IT organizations. From the perspective of an experienced IT manager, the course prepares the student to apply Agile techniques to attain advanced leadership and management responsibilities in a enterprise environment. Course instructors draw from their own real-life experience to immerse the student in actual business scenarios.  From there, instructors provide guidance in the application of Agile techniques. After completing the course, participants will be able to demonstrate their knowledge of the theory and practice needed for Agile leadership.  All students who successfully complete the course will be prepared to take the Certified Agile Leadership 1 exam.

We find that today\u2019s businesses are too often focused on delivering products and specific product features without taking into consideration their ultimate value to the customer. Value streams start with and focus specifically on business value provided to the customer. Understanding value streams becomes increasingly important as the complexity of your organization grows. Drawing upon parallels from the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), many of the techniques that help with coordination and interconnection between Agile processes will also be shown effective at coordinating and delivering value at scale. In this workshop you will partner and collaborate with other students representing a broad swath of your corporate know-how. Under the expert guidance of experienced facilitators, you will have the opportunity to immerse yourself in several actual business challenges and then learn how value stream coordination can help you manage the many competing requirements that may interfere with delivering value. You will have the opportunity to experience, practice, and apply new ways of thinking about delivering customer value. In demonstrations of complex organizations, you will see how these practices scale to meet your challenges.
